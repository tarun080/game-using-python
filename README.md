# game-using-python
we have used two libraries here
1. import sys
2. import time
In import sys library we have used sys.stdout.write() serves the same purpose as the object stands for except it prints the number of letters within the text too when used in interactive mode. sys.stdout.flush() forces it to “flush” the buffer, meaning that it will write everything in the buffer to the terminal, even if normally it would wait before doing so. 
In import time we gave a time lag for the sentence to print a statement after few seconds.
